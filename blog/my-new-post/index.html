This is not a post about Rust but rather the thought process on getting started with a new programming language (or multiple languages) in a world where these languages are driving technologies like cloud services, blockchains and artificial intelligence.
We live in a time where the frontier of modern technology is looking to solve problems that no longer appear to be solvable by a single person, so in learning a new language we are presented with a spectrum of opportunities that lie somewhere between programming &ldquo;hello-world&rdquo; and a distributed blockchain.
When learning a programming language, there comes a time when you have to eventually program.
In doing so it is important to choose a task/project that is within the realm of possibility so as to not dishearten and hinder learning progress, but also provide a sense of accomplishment that programming another version of grep simply will not provide.</p><p>In an attempt to find an interesting project to build in order to learn Rust, I decided to google around for some ideas.
I cannot recall where, but one commenter suggested that instead of trying to find a project, rather ask yourself:</p><p>What do you want to make the computer do?</p><p>This can be seen as obvious advice, but it struck me as rather profound.
Having programmed for years, I honestly cannot think of a time when I thought &ldquo;What do I want to make the computer do&rdquo;.
I would imagine that I am not alone in feeling this way.
In our daily work-lives we are assigned all sorts of tasks to instruct the computer to do impressive things:</p><ul><li>Serve an interactive website to the world over a port using a secure protocol.</li><li>Move data from this database to that SFTP server using a serverless event-driven architecture.</li><li>Learn mathematical parameters from this dataset and use them in an equation to predict some future behaviour.</li></ul><p>All of which are posed to us as a problem to solve given a certain set of tools, a hyperthetical set of building blocks that we can piece together to achieve the predefined goal.
I think the value underlying the advice of &ldquo;What do you want to make the computer do?&rdquo; is two fold:</p><ol><li>Have you ever thought what you want to make the computer do? Not what someone else wants it to do or thinks it should do.</li><li>With the packages and modules available in most programming language ecosystems, spinning up a webserver or training a machine learning model is often so trivial (think Flask/Scikit-Learn) that one could argue that your effort in making the computer do something is fairly insignificant, you were just along for the ride.</li></ol><p>My argument is therefore:</p><ol><li><p>Program something that you want to make the computer do that serves only you and not some peer-pressured agenda based on the current hype.
Instead of building another grep or a multithreaded webserver.
Find a problem/area of interest in our life that you believe could be solved by a programme within your grasp and attempt to make it.
It doesn&rsquo;t matter if there is a package out there that does what you want, that is not the point.
Just build it, publish it and enjoy it.</p></li><li><p>Try no-dependancy learning (within reason).</p></li></ol><p>You are never going to learn multithreaded programming by using a package that does it for you, nor are you going to find any fulfillment in importing that package to do so.</p><p>It is the resistance to learning that makes it fulfilling and forces you out of your comfort zone, where true learning takes place.
Of course, these are just my opinions but I would love to hear if the statement resonates with you too and if you have found fulfillment in learning this way.</p><p>Happy building!"</p></content><p><a href=https://danreia.github.io/tags/thoughts/>#Thoughts</a></p></main><footer>Made with <a href=https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/>Hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear</a></footer></body></html>
