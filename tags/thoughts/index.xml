This is not a post about Rust but rather the thought process on getting started with a new programming language (or multiple languages) in a world where these languages are driving technologies like cloud services, blockchains and artificial intelligence. We live in a time where the frontier of modern technology is looking to solve problems that no longer appear to be solvable by a single person, so in learning a new language we are presented with a spectrum of opportunities that lie somewhere between programming &amp;ldquo;hello-world&amp;rdquo; and a distributed blockchain.</description></item></channel></rss>
